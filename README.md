ACE Connect is an innovative web-based platform designed to provide comprehensive details about current students, alumni and faculty members of a college. This project aims to facilitate seamless communication, networking and information sharing within the college community. ACE Connect will feature user-friendly interfaces, robust system integration and high-level security measures to ensure a smooth and secure user experience. By using advanced web technologies, ACE Connect will bridge the gap between different user groups, fostering a stronger and more connected community. Current students can access profiles of faculty members for academic guidance, connect with alumni for mentorship, career advice and stay updated on campus events and announcements. Alumni can use the platform to reconnect with former classmates, offer     career guidance to current students and stay connected with the college. Faculty members can use ACE Connect to communicate with students outside of the classroom and can share resources. With its evident design and robust features, ACE Connect serves as a central hub for bringing up meaningful connections, promoting collaboration and enhancing the overall college experience for students, alumni and faculty alike. This project report details the system analysis and requirements specifications necessary for the successful development and implementation of ACE Connect.
